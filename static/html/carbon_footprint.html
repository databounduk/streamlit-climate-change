    The average UK homeâ€™s carbon footprint has reduced by 4.7 tonnes of CO2 since 1990. 
    A further reduction of 3.6 tonnes by 2030 will help keep us on track to the 80% UK-wide reduction in emissions by 2050 required to tackle dangerous climate change.

    In 2019, the average house generated a total of approx 45 tonnes of carbon emissions.
    Therefore, in order to reach the 2030 target we would need to reduce our carbon emissions by 8%.
    The plot below provides a breakdown of some typical carbon emissions over a year per household.
