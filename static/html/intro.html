    We at Databound take our environmental impact seriously!

    Over the last several weeks the team at Databound started thinking about what it really means to be carbon neutral.
    Companies and people emphasise that for every tree they cut down, they plant anothers to off-set the effects.
    What is the true impact and how long does it take to trap that much carbon?

<p>
    Using python and streamlit as a ui, we can look at the estimate the amount of carbon trapped by a tree of a certain age.
    With data collected by a number of sources (available in the readme), we can the estimate the number of trees and or time it would take to re-capture that much carbon.
    Then we can look at the costs associated with the carbon capture, either by planting more trees or via new carbon capture techniques.

    So have a go below. We have also intergrated graphs from Oxford University to show you deforestation and CO2 emmissions over the past 20 plus years.
